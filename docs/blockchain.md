# Blockchain

### Principles
- Is run by a network of nodes
- Each node maintains a copy of the entire blockchain
- Developers will use the address of a node to make requests to the blockchain
  - Usually you will use a node provider to make it easier to connect to a node without having to maintain it, but you can maintain a node by yourself as well if you want ;)
- A node also has a local memory of transactions (called `mempool`). If there are transactions waiting to be mined they will be in the `mempool`!

### Random realisations

Users pay for their stuff, and they pay the cost of the computation (+maybe some transparent fees)
As opposed to random prices dictated by the companies

In a way this provides competition in an environment where there is no competition

- Set the gas limit
- Speed up a transaction will increase the gas fee so the transaction passes quicker
  - Speeding up a transaction basically allows to resubmit a transaction
